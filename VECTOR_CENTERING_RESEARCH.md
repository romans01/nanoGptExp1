## üß† Core Concept: Vector Centering

### Theoretical Foundation

Vector centering is a technique that:
1. **Shifts the origin** of vector representations to their centroid
2. **Re-normalizes** vectors to unit length
3. **Increases angular separation** between vectors
4. **Improves representational capacity** of the embedding space

### Mathematical Formulation

For a set of vectors `X = {x‚ÇÅ, x‚ÇÇ, ..., x‚Çô}`:

```
1. Compute centroid: c = (1/n) * Œ£ x·µ¢
2. Center vectors: x'·µ¢ = x·µ¢ - c  
3. Normalize: x''·µ¢ = x'·µ¢ / ||x'·µ¢||
```

### Implementation Modes

- **Simple**: Batch-wise centering
- **Adaptive**: Running statistics with momentum
- **Learnable**: Trainable centering parameters
- **Momentum**: Exponential moving average centering

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Guidelines

### Production Deployment

#### **Conservative Approach** (Recommended for production)
```python
config = AdvancedGPTConfig(
    center_embeddings=True,     # üéØ Highest impact, lowest risk
    centering_mode='adaptive'   # Stable and effective
)
```

#### **Aggressive Approach** (For research/experimentation)
```python
config = AdvancedGPTConfig(
    center_embeddings=True,     # Input layer
    center_qk=True,            # Query/Key attention
    center_v=True,             # Value attention  
    centering_mode='adaptive'   # Balanced approach
)
```

### Performance Considerations

- **Computational Overhead:** ~5-10% increase in training time
- **Memory Usage:** Minimal additional memory required
- **Convergence:** May require slightly different learning rates
- **Stability:** Disable compilation for centered models (current limitation)

### Monitoring and Debugging

```python
# Enable centering statistics
logits, loss, centering_stats = model(x, return_centering_stats=True)

# Monitor centering effectiveness
for stat_name, stats in centering_stats:
    print(f"{stat_name}: center_norm={stats['center_norm']:.4f}")
```
