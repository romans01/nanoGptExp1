Enter KING RICHARD II, with his nobles.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Northumberland, my lord,
To help me some of my lord.

KING RICHARD II:
An if I was; and yet I am mad
To speak'd to be king, and what I am,
Please your king; for your son, I charge you,
To fight against him in the weary way
Your own right noble Gloucester done.

DUKE OF YORK:
Good prince, I do beseech your majesty,
Be ready at the Tower and not himself.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I never shall be patient; for my Lord Aumerle.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Dispose of you, on me; your day is banish'd.

KING RICHARD II:
A king, I have but dream'd the king,
Nor I within my gage, my loyal knee,
As mine, by me no man's tongue:
Although I do not banish'd, I see thee,
As I was; for I do wish myself
For with an ungovern'd and I did swear
For dying men a two deep a head
For that I was a king's majesty!
For that I have a king, I was a king:
By him I's, I have not I was a king;
And all my life, but now to lay
For I am the crown'd upon my face.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Long may you say, I know your majesty
To rages and your grace: when your noble lords
My grief we have yielded upon a grief
To dimmish your highness to your sorrow.

KING RICHARD II:
There is no cause: he is some other's,
To come the way what it is.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
As for my gracious sovereign liege, I do not swear
By heaven, as my grief hath done.

KING RICHARD II:
I swear, 'tis you king; but all:
That I shall be, I have, and then my sick,
You shall not sue to be, of your love.
Therefore, give me leave, I make you pardon.

KING
